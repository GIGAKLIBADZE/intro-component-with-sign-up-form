### What I learned

After creating many HTML/CSS projects, then adding a lot of ones built with the DOM, I can confidently say that I am now completely familiar with the DOM structure and its basics. Now, I started learning of React and it is my third porject with this library. I plan to continue working on projects involving the React to deepen my understanding.
